# xmpush-python
A **python3** library forked from [Xiaomi push python SDK](https://dev.mi.com/mipush/downpage/python.html)

The main purpose is to support distribute this SDK via PyPI.

## Latest changes
- Initial version and no changes at all.

## Install
```bash
pip install xmpush-python
```

or download from [here](https://github.com/ULHI-xin/xmpush-python/releases/download/0.0.2/xmpush-python-1.0.3.tar.gz)
then run
```bash
pip install xmpush-python-1.0.3.tar.gz
(Suppose xmpush-python-1.0.3.tar.gz is the local file downloaded)
```

## Licence
Apache 2.0
The original SDK by Xiaomi is developed under `Apache Software License` and it's not modified.
I cannot find any license declaration in the original copy of code.
