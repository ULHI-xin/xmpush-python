# xmpush-python
A *python3* library forked from [Xiaomi push python SDK](https://dev.mi.com/mipush/downpage/python.html)
The main purpose is to support distribute this SDK via PyPI.

## Latest changes
- Initial version and no changes at all.

## Install
``pip install xmpush-python``

## Licence
Apache 2.0
The original SDK by Xiaomi is developed under ``Apache Software License`` and it's not modified.
I cannot find any license declaration in the original copy of code.
